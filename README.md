A super-lean MVVM implementation in Swift (with no 3rd-party stuff)

Really excited about bringing MVVM into my apps, so wanted to start with a very simple implementation to get the basics down. Though MVVM in Swift can be paired with Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) tools like ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift, this particular example has no third party dependency. Instead, it implements the technique written about by Srdan Rasic here: http://rasic.info/bindings-generics-swift-and-mvvm/.
